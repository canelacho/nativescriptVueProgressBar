# Nativescript Vue example : Animate progress bars

There are many ways to animate things on the web, but in mobile applications I thought it was not possible, but with some persistence I did it my way.

Here I'm using:
- NativeScript
- Vue
- Animate.CSS 
and of course 
-CSS
- Javascript. 

For me this was a simple way to do it, Enjoy it!

Feel free to use it if you need it, the playground link ["here!"](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=play-vue&id=9ItFYk&v=42)
