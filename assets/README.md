# Nativescript Vue example : Animate progress bars

There is many ways to animate things in web but in mobile apps I was thinking it cannot be possible but with a little of persistence I did on my way.

Here I'm using:
- NativeScript
- Vue
- Animate.CSS 
and of course 
-CSS
- Javascript. 

For me this was a simple way to do it, Enjoy!
